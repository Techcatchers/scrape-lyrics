# Web scraping lyrics with Genius and Musixmatch
Get lyrics of a song by just passing in the song name. There are 2 methods used to find the lyrics for a song so if 1 method fails to find the lyrics for the song then another method comes to the rescue and finds it and returns in a well-formatted lyrics ready for educational use. But if both the method fails than it returns 'No lyrics found for the song.'

We are using selenium with Python3 in this project. We can also use Google API to get 5 times faster results but there are some issues with finding the right results for songs on Musixmatch using Google APIs but I have tested Genius with Google custom search API and the results are pretty fast.

### Requirements:
* Python installed on your machine
